# Customer Churn Prediction System 📉

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on account features such as tenure, monthly charges, and service usage.

## 📁 Dataset

We used the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) containing ~7,000 customer records with various service attributes.

## 💡 Objective

Build a classification model that predicts customer churn and provide insights into factors contributing to it.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps

- Cleaned and encoded categorical data
- Handled missing values and feature scaling
- Trained logistic regression model
- Evaluated model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualized performance metrics

## 📈 Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of ~85%, with good balance between precision and recall.
